## Note about ozip decrypt
* This is necessary for downgrades back to stock android-9.0 (ColorOS).
* Early versions of android-10.0(Realme UI v1) have decryptor built into the updater binary so this patch isnt necessary.
* Later versions of android-10.0(Realme UI v1) are not ozip encrypted at all and so is android-11.0 (Realme UI v2) potentially following the OPLUS merger.
* To automate renaming .ozip to .zip, ozip decrypt tool can be used with dummy key for devices launching with android 10 and above.
